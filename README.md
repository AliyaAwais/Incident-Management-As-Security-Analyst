This guide provides procedures for identifying, responding to, and mitigating various security incidents. 

It aims to ensure a consistent, effective approach to incident management, minimizing impact and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible.

Incident Types

1 :- Malware Attacks

Identification: Unusual system behavior, slow performance, or unauthorized processes.

Response: Isolate affected systems, run antivirus scans, remove malware, and update signatures.

2:- Phishing Attempts

Identification: Suspicious emails requesting sensitive information.

Response: Do not interact with the email, report to IT, and educate users on recognizing phishing.

3:- Data Breaches

Identification: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, and alerts from monitoring tools.

Response: Contain breach, identify compromised data, notify affected parties, and follow legal reporting requirements.

4:- Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

Identification: Unusual traffic spikes, and slow network performance.

Response: Activate DoS protection measures, identify sources, and mitigate traffic.

Incident Response Process

1:-Detection and Reporting

Monitor systems continuously and report suspicious activities immediately.

2:-Assessment

Confirm the incident, assess its scope and impact, and prioritize response actions.

3:-Containment

Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.

4:-Eradication

Remove the root cause of the incident, such as eliminating malware or closing vulnerabilities.

5:-Recovery

Restore systems to normal operations, apply patches, and restore data from backups.

6:-Post-Incident Review

Analyze the incident to understand its cause, improve response procedures, and implement additional security measures.
