Scenario - Dashlane- Major Breach
You've been hired to come in as a Security Analyst working for Dashlane.
Dashlane, a password management service, recently discovered a hole in the system, which has resulted in 5.4 million usersâ€™s information being stolen and sold online.
Dashlane is interested in trying some different forms of protection on their system to ensure users' data stays protected. 
Your CTO is concerned that this stems from a strange email someone received earlier that month. 
You will be working closely with Jeffery Mariner to complete this project.
